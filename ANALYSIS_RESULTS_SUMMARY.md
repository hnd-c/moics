## How to Interpret the Visualizations

### Top Panel: Time Distribution Histogram

**What it shows:**
- Number of applications in each time bin (0-7d, 8-14d, 15-30d, etc.)
- Distribution shape (normal, skewed, bimodal)
- Statistical markers (median, mean, 95th percentile)

**Key questions:**
- What's the typical processing time? (Look at median/mean)
- How much variability is there? (Spread of the distribution)
- Are there outliers? (Applications in 180+ days bin)
- Is the distribution concentrated or spread out?

**Distribution patterns:**
- **Left-skewed (fast):** Most applications in early bins → Efficient process
- **Right-skewed (slow):** Long tail to the right → Some applications get delayed
- **Bimodal:** Two peaks → Two different processing patterns (fast-track vs standard?)
- **Uniform:** Spread across bins → Inconsistent processing times

### Bottom Panel: Transition Breakdown by Time Bin

**What it shows:**
- For each time bin, shows average percentage of time spent on different transitions
- Color-coded: Blue shades = forward transitions, Orange = review cycles
- Stacked bars sum to 100% (represents entire processing time)

**Key questions:**
- Do fast applications follow a different pattern than slow ones?
- Which transitions take the most time in delayed applications?
- Are review cycles more prominent in slow bins?
- Where do applications get stuck?

**Patterns to identify:**

**FAST APPLICATIONS (0-7d, 8-14d):**
- Larger segments for early transitions (1→2, 2→3)
- Minimal or no review cycle segments (orange)
- May show completion at lower auth levels (fewer transitions)
- Quick progression through each stage

**SLOW APPLICATIONS (60-90d, 90+d):**
- More balanced segment sizes (no single quick transition)
- Prominent review cycle segments (orange bars)
- More segments overall (passing through more levels)
- Specific transition may dominate (bottleneck indicator)

**BOTTLENECK IDENTIFICATION:**
- If one transition takes >30-40% of time in slow bins → That's your bottleneck
- If review cycles (orange) are >25% in slow bins → Rework is a major issue
- Compare same transition across bins: if it's 10% in fast bin but 40% in slow bin → Critical bottleneck

## Analysis Workflow

### Step 1: Review Each Process Individually

For each of the 6 generated files:

1. **Check the distribution (Top Panel)**
   - Is it concentrated (good) or spread out (inconsistent)?
   - What's the median processing time?
   - What percentage complete within 30 days? 60 days?

2. **Identify patterns (Bottom Panel)**
   - Compare first bin vs last bin
   - Which transitions change most between fast and slow applications?
   - Are review cycles increasing in slower bins?

### Step 2: Compare Across Processes

Look at all 6 visualizations side-by-side:

- Which process is fastest overall?
- Which has most variability?
- Are bottlenecks at similar levels across processes?
- Do all processes show similar review cycle patterns?

### Step 3: Identify Specific Issues

For each bottleneck identified:

- **Note the specific transition** (e.g., "Level 3→4 in Visa Recommendation")
- **Quantify the impact** (e.g., "Takes 35% of time in 90+d applications")
- **Compare with fast applications** (e.g., "Only 15% in 0-7d applications")
- **Identify the delta** (e.g., "20% difference = major improvement opportunity")

### Step 4: Formulate Recommendations

Based on findings:

1. **Quick Wins:** Processes with clear single bottlenecks
2. **Review Process Improvements:** Where review cycles dominate
3. **Resource Allocation:** Add staff at specific authority levels
4. **Process Redesign:** Where multiple bottlenecks exist
5. **Best Practice Sharing:** Learn from fast-track patterns

## Example: How to Read the Charts

### Hypothetical Example: Industry Registration

**Top Panel shows:**
- 85 apps in 0-7d (fast-track)
- 210 apps in 8-14d (normal)
- 280 apps in 15-30d (standard)
- 120 apps in 31-60d (delayed)
- 58 apps in 61-90d (problem cases)
- Median: 28 days

**Bottom Panel reveals:**

**0-7d bin (fast-track):**
- L1→L2: 50% (half the time on initial review)
- L2→L3: 40% (quick second review)
- L3+: 10% (minimal higher level processing)
- **Pattern:** Quick through first two levels, complete at level 3

**31-60d bin (delayed):**
- L1→L2: 20% (initial review faster than fast-track - not the issue)
- L2→L3: 15% (also faster - not the issue)
- L3_review: 25% ⚠️ (BOTTLENECK - stuck in level 3 reviews)
- L3→L4: 15%
- L4+: 25%
- **Pattern:** Getting stuck in level 3 review cycles is the main differentiator

**Insight:**
Fast applications complete at level 3, but delayed applications:
1. Get stuck in level 3 review cycles (25% of total time)
2. Then have to proceed to levels 4+ (another 40% of time)

**Actionable recommendation:**
- Improve level 3 review process to reduce rework
- Provide clearer guidance to applicants before level 3
- Consider pre-screening to avoid level 3 rejections

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Open and review each visualization**
   - Start with largest processes (Visa Recommendation, Industry Registration)
   - Look for obvious bottlenecks
   - Note surprising patterns

2. **Document key findings**
   - Which transitions are bottlenecks?
   - Where are review cycles excessive?
   - What do fast applications do differently?

3. **Validate with stakeholders**
   - Do the patterns match their experience?
   - Can they explain why certain transitions are slow?
   - What are the barriers they face?

### Deep Dive Analysis (Optional)

If you want to investigate further:

1. **Drill down on specific bins**
   - Pull list of applications in fast vs slow bins
   - Read actual remarks/comments for those applications
   - Interview processors handling those levels

2. **Temporal analysis**
   - Modify script to create separate charts by year
   - Check if bottlenecks are improving or worsening
   - Track impact of any process changes

3. **Industry category analysis**
   - Segment by industry type (Tourism, Service, ICT, etc.)
   - See if certain industries move faster/slower
   - Identify industry-specific bottlenecks

4. **Role-specific analysis**
   - Modify script to break down by role instead of auth level
   - Identify which roles/teams are bottlenecks
   - Resource allocation decisions
